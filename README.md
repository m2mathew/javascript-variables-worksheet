## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `index.html`

### Requirements

* Create a new git repository with an index.html file. Answer each of the questions below and put the answer into your index.html file using a `<table>`.


## Normal Mode
Review the code below. For each snippet of code, determine what the final expression will evaluate to.

### Snippet #1

Evaluate this expression: `100+4`

### Snippet #2

Evaluate this expression: `'a'+'b'`

### Snippet #3

Evaluate this expression: `'Bob'+'Smith'`

### Snippet #4

Evaluate this expression: `'7'+'9'`

### Snippet #5

Evaluate this expression: `'7'+9`

### Snippet #6

Evaluate this expression: `'7'-9`

### Snippet #7

Evaluate this expression: `'abc'*3`

### Snippet #8

Evaluate this expression: `7+2*3`

### Snippet #9

Evaluate this expression: `(7+2)*3`

### Snippet #10

Evaluate this expression: `(null+2)/3`

### Snippet #11

```js
var name;
```
Evaluate this expression: `name`

### Snippet #12

```js
var x = 7;
var y = 4;
var z = x * y;
```
Evaluate this expression: `z-3`

### Snippet #13

```js
var a = true;
var b = false;
```
Evaluate this expression: `a && b`

### Snippet #14

```js
var a = true;
var b = false;
```
Evaluate this expression: `a || b`

### Snippet #15

```js
var foo = 3;
foo++;
foo++;
```
Evaluate this expression: `foo/2`

### Snippet #16

```js
var age = 29.8;
var wholeAge = Math.floor(age);
var nextAge = Math.ceil(age);
```
Evaluate this expression: `nextAge - wholeAge`

### Snippet #17

Evaluate this expression: `'5' + 3 - 3`

### Snippet #18

```js
var isRed = false;
isRed = !isRed;
```
Evaluate this expression: `isRed`

### Snippet #19

```js
var isBlue = true;
var isBlue = !!isBlue;
```
Evaluate this expression: `isBlue`

### Snippet #20

```js
var name = 'Sally';
var age = 25;
```
Evaluate this expression: `name.length + age`

### Snippet #21

```js
var x = 10;
var y = 73.3;

var point = '[' + x + ', ' + y + ']';
```
Evaluate this expression: `'point: '+point`

### Snippet #22

```js
var numberOfSheep = 16;
var numberOfGoats = 3;
```
Evaluate this expression: `numberOfGoats + numberOfSheep++`

### Snippet #23

```js
var numberOfSheep = 16;
var numberOfGoats = 3;
```
Evaluate this expression: `numberOfGoats - ++numberOfSheep`

### Snippet #24

```js
var x;
var y = (x=7);
```

Evaluate this expression: `y`


## Notes

Try to answer each one of these without actually running the code via node or inside of the console. After you pick your answer, you can look up the answer by running the code.
